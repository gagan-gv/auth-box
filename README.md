# AuthBox
AuthBox delivers a modular, standards-based architecture that supports OIDC, while offering deployment flexibility as either a system of record or a broker to client-managed stores. It includes encrypted data storage, asynchronous email services for MFA and password resets, and an admin dashboard for user and role management. Designed for replication per client via IaC, this IdP ensures isolation, compliance, and scalability, making it secure and extensible for modern enterprise needs.
